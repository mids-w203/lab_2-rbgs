```{r load packages}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load functions from other cleaning docs}
count_blank_na <- function(in_df, column_name = in_df[1]) {
  # Purpose: quick count of blanks or NA values in a column
  # Input: df, column_name to be checked 
  # - defaults to first column if none provided
  # Output: number of blanks in column
  
  in_df %>%
  filter({{ column_name }} == "" | 
           is.na({{ column_name }})) %>%
  nrow() %>% cat("\n")
}

```


First, load all of the data from our cleaned CSV files
```{r load csvs to df}
# Load all cleaned cusp CSVs to consolidate
cusp_closure <- read.csv2("~/mids_w203_sp_21/lab_2-rbgs/data/interim/CUSP/closures_and_reopening.csv")
cusp_masks <- read.csv2("~/mids_w203_sp_21/lab_2-rbgs/data/interim/CUSP/face_masks.csv")
cusp_home <- read.csv2("~/mids_w203_sp_21/lab_2-rbgs/data/interim/CUSP/stay_at_home.csv")

# Load mobility data
mobility <- read.csv("~/mids_w203_sp_21/lab_2-rbgs/data/interim/mobility.csv")

# Load COVID cases data
covid <- read.csv("~/mids_w203_sp_21/lab_2-rbgs/data/interim/nyt_covid.csv")
```

Make sure the five datasets all have the same formats/values for joined columns
1. state
2. date (covid and mobility only)

```{r check joining fields}
names(covid)
names(mobility)

# STATE
  state_intersect <- list(
                        covid$state, 
                        mobility$state, 
                        cusp_closure$state, 
                        cusp_home$state, 
                        cusp_masks$state)
  
  # Check intersect
  length(Reduce(intersect, state_intersect))
  
  # Check difference length
  length(Reduce(setdiff, state_intersect))
  
  # Note all states outside set are only contained in 1 df, and not part of 
  # contiguous US
  Reduce(setdiff, state_intersect)

# DATE
  # make sure there are no NAs
  covid %>%
    count_blank_na()
  
  mobility %>%
    count_blank_na()
  
  # Check min and max dates
  min(covid$date)
  max(covid$date)
  min(mobility$date)
  max(mobility$date)
```

Now, Join the two time series datasets together. We know from previous cleaning, that covid date has different start date for each state - depending on the date of their first reported covid case. For the mobility dataset, each state had the exact same number of aggregate observations between 2/15/2020 and 3/14/2021. For this reason, we will use these dates as the set of base dates, and augment with any information available from covid. 

Additionally, the covid dataset (once first date occurs) has no "holes" in data, as discovered in covid cleaning markdown. There will be some NAs before the first date, but we do not expect NAs after the first reported case. 

Finally, the mobility file has all of the relevant states of interest, so keying off mobility states rather than covid states will leave us with the correct state list. 
```{r join covid and mobility}

# left join is appropriate here, since mobility has all of our dates, states, of interest
time_series <- mobility %>% 
  left_join(covid, by = c("state", "date")) %>%
  select(state, date, avg_retail_rec_change, new_cases)

# Spot check: 
# knowing first cases in alabama were 3/14, do a quick check before and after
time_series %>%
  filter(state == "Alabama", date == c("2020-03-14", "2020-03-13"))
```

Now, we want to add a few indicator variables to our dataset
1. `in_quarantine`: whether or not the state has a mandated stay_at_home order during at current date
2. `quarantine_length`: the duration (at current) for stay at home order

```{r}

```
